          <p>
            I am a 4th year Ph.D. student in EECS at MIT exploring the theoretical limits of equivariant neural networks. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Tess Smidt in the <a href="https://atomicarchitects.github.io">Atomic Architects</a> group.

            I previously completed my B.S. in Physics and Math at MIT.
